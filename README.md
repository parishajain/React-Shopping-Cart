# React-Shopping-Cart
Today I build a shopping cart and product listing using best practices and React and React Router v4. In this project, I set up React Router and loaded a products list via json and build the 'add to cart' functionality and payment options. I used various interesting CSS properties which gave a nice styling to the project.
